    <h1>Garlic-Parmesan Shrimp</h1>

    <img src="../images/garlic-shrimp.webp">

    <p>Delicious crispy shrimp coated in a bread crump-Parmesan mixture. My Family can't get enough of it! 
       I would suggest doubling the recipe if you have very large eaters because this is addictive!
       Serve with pasta and salad.
